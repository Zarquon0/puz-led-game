# puz-led-game
Puz-led is a simple web word/logic game involving moving letter tiles around a grid to form a partially obscured word. It's not a wordle variant but the idea to build a web puzzle game was loosely inspired by wordle. A new puzzle is generated every day, however, you are also given the option to input a custom seed and have the website generate a puzzle for you. Enjoy!
